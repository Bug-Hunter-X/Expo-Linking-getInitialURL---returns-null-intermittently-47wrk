This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is opened, leading to unexpected behavior in the application.  This is inconsistent and unreliable.  The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.
